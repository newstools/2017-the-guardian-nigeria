Speaking during the handover ceremony, Group Executive Director, NNPC and Chief Operating Officer Gas and Power, Saidu Mohammed, said the project has been defined a long time ago, which the company is willing to implement. Axxela Limited, a Sub-Saharan Africa gas and power portfolio company, has completed and submitted a feasibility study to the Nigerian Gas Processing and Transportation Company (NGPTC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), to build a 510 Kilometre ELPS-Ibadan-Ilorin-Jebba (EIIJ) pipeline network across the Western and Central states of Nigeria. The study was compiled by world-renowned US-based consultant agency, Worley Parsons, and supported by counterpart funding from the United States Trade and Development Authority (USTDA). Speaking during the handover ceremony, Group Executive Director, NNPC and Chief Operating Officer Gas and Power, Saidu Mohammed, said the project has been defined a long time ago, which the company is willing to implement. “It’s key we don’t lose sight of the low-hanging fruits, as we seek to provide gas to the country in keeping with the national plan,” he said. The proposed pipeline project was conceived as part of the Nigeria Gas Master Plan to improve power generation and distribution to major cities within Nigeria’s South-Western region. The pipeline is expected to commence in Ibadan, Oyo and run through the towns of Osogbo, Ogbomoso, Ilorin, Ado-Ekiti, and terminate in Jebba located in Kwara. Chief Executive Officer, Axxela, Bolaji Osunsanya, said the impetus for power-driven initiatives is underscored by the significance of this project, and its impact and scope are parallel with the Federal Government’s aspirations to improve the power situation. Ultimately, major demand centers will require more electricity to cater to the growing power requirements of industrial and commercial clusters.
