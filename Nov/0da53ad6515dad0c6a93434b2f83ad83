The world’s leading manufacturer of motion and control technologies, Parker Hannifin Corp. U.S.A., in collaboration with Offshore Dimensions, have launched the first ever Packer Store in Nigeria. While speaking with The Guardian, the Managing Director, Offshore Dimension Nigeria Limited, Seun Faluyi, said the partnership is to setup an official presence in the country, to support the Nigerian Content Law, which the government has been driving, especially in terms of domesticating the production of goods by Nigerians. He maintained that the partnership with Parker will propel the industrial growth of the nation with their products which are of international quality standard and can compete favourably globally with other international companies. Faluyi said: “It’s very exciting for us. We are proudly saying that we are now producing some of these parts in Nigeria, and it is going to raise the standard of engineering and manufacturing in the country, and Parker does not compromise on its standard. “We plan to increase our manufacturing capability in Nigeria. We have started producing our high pressure hoses locally and we have learnt this from working with Parker. We will start producing pneumatics cylinders and gears soon and this is a very exciting beginning for us.” Faluyi, concluded that the products will also help entrepreneurs, who are into production to compete favourably with those producing abroad, as Parker equipment are world class, and as such can only give world class output when used. He urged large conglomerates, small manufacturers and industrialists to patronise Parker Store in Nigeria, and get the best quality, which is produced locally by Nigerians, rather than going abroad to buy. The Business Development Manager, Middle East and Africa, Parker Hannifin Corporation, Ignacio Garcia, expressed joy to be in Nigeria for the launch, which he said is of high significance. His words: “I think it’s important to have local content. This is what we have been doing in the last six to seven years for Africa; upgrading local content for people locally, and they are able to grow their businesses themselves with the support of a multinational company like Parker Hannifin.”  To enable commenting and other interactive features, please switch to the more advanced .
