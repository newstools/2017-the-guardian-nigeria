 First City Monument Bank plc, FCMB.  The completion of the transaction follows the approvals of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the National Pension Commission (PENCOM), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). FCMB Group’s acquisition of Legacy Pension is set to open a new vista of sustained growth for Legacy through the enhanced distribution and market presence.
Analysts have hailed the acquisition, saying it is a significant development that would enhance the future performance of both organisations. They anticipate that Legacy Pension is now better positioned to grow its market share, compete effectively on the Retirement Savings Account (RSA) portability, and also enter the micro-pensions segment in the informal market by leveraging on the FCMB’s network, the retail and commercial banking arm of FCMB Group. FCMB Group Plc’s subsidiaries include: First City Monument Bank Limited, FCMB Capital Markets, CSL Stockbrokers Limited, CSL Trustees Limited, First City Asset Management Limited, FCMB Microfinance Limited and now, Legacy Pension Managers Limited. FCMB Group has over 4.3 million customers and 204 branches in Nigeria and a banking subsidiary in the United Kingdom through FCMB Bank (UK) Limited (which is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the PRA in the United Kingdom).
