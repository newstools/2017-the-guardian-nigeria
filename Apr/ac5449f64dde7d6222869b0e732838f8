Explaining the policy, the Executive Chairman of Abia State Board of Internal Revenue (BIR), Mr. Udochukwu Ogbonna, who explained that the tax policy did not provide for appointment of revenue agents, directed that all tax payments be made in any of the government approved IGR accounts in the designated banks. He further added that all arrangements have been put in place to ensure that tax payers pay their taxes with ease, enforce payments when due and avoid evasion but cautioned against patronizing touts or agents. He also said that issuing of Demand Notices have commenced and urged those that have not obtained the “Consolidated Demand Notice” to visit the nearest BIR offices in Aba and Umuahia to get their demand notices for payment. On the on-going enumeration exercise being effected by BIR officers, which he said was in compliance to the acquisition of Abia Tax Identification Number (A-TIN), Ogbonna told Tax Payers especially artisans to pay all taxes.
